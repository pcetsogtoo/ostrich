4.5.0
-----
release: 28 June 2011

- Requires util 1.9.0, which introduces the validate() method on Config.

- validate() on Configs is called automatically in RuntimeEnvironment when
  loading a config.

- Fixed admin port "/" path, and added an "X-Ostrich-Version" header to all
  responses.


4.4.0
-----
release: 14 June 2011

- StatsListener computes distributions as deltas just like it does for
  counters.

- Distribution is now just a thin immutable wrapper around a Histogram, and
  FanoutMetric now has the same behavior as FanoutCounter.

- Min/max are now computed on the histogram and vary across samples. Count
  and sum have been pushed into Histogram.

- Added 95th percentile to reported stats.


4.3.0
-----
release: 1 June 2011

- track sum in Metric and Distribution and derive mean

4.2.0
-----
release: 9 May 2011

- Derived metrics (i.e. average, max, min, percentiles) are now exposed only when there are one or
  more events in a metric's histogram.

- Added admin command "stats?namespace=<name>", which will report a named StatsListener.

- Removed old hooks for adding admin HTTP path handlers. You have to use the config fields in
  AdminServiceConfig now.

- Added several GC-related counters & gauges to stats.

- Added support to the admin "server_info" command for two new build fields: current branch alias
  and the last few commit summaries (requires standard-project >= 0.12.4).

- Improved documentation significantly.


4.1.0
